# A Little Survey

Here are just a few questions so I can get to know you and so you can get practice submitting an assignment in Canvas.  For each question, insert your answer underneath. Make sure each answer is at the minimum a complete sentence with correctly spelled words and correct puncuation. 

## A short history of you.  
Where did you attend High School, and did you graduate? Compare english class to math, is one easier for you than the other? Finally which subject did you do the best in? Your answer should have at least two sentences devoted to each question.  
  
### my answer     
  I went to High School at Antelope Valley Learning Academy under the organization Learn4Life. I graduated a year and a half early with online coursework. I love math because of its definitive nature, unlike English which is up to interpretation. The subject I did best in was Algebra II. Interestingly, I dislike Statistics.
     
## Your computer and your and its capability?  
 For this class  you need a computer you can use at home.  So, what kind is it (windows, Apple, Linux)?  On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is a total dummy (doesn't know a mouse from a keyboard) and 10 is a complete geek (knows computer stuff in and out) How do you rate yourself?  You also need to have have internet access. How is your connection to the internet where you live?

### my answer   
  I have a Windows desktop, an HP Omen. My computer was purchased primarily for gaming, but I consider myself to be moderate in terms of computer knowledge, probably a 6. I live in Tehachapi so the wind can conflict with internet connection, but it shouldn't be too much of an issue.
   

## Others and You?   
What name do you prefer to be called by your classmates and instructor, if your buddys call you something but you want people in the class to call you something else - what would that be? 

### my answer     
  
   
 




## Aspirations?   
What do you want to achieve in life?  What college subject do you think would be of the greatest interest to you? What degree or certificate are you trying to achieve?

### my answer     
  
   
 




## Past adventures?  
Have you ever gone to foreign countries, if so which ones, if not Where might you go in the future?  Have you ever been in the military, if so which branch, if not which branch would you choose if you got drafted, and why?

### my answer     
  
   
  




## Why are you taking Statistics?  
Did you take Math 115 or Math 116 ?  Did you know Math 115 only satisfies a general education requirement but that Math 116 counts as taking statistics in several transfer institutions??  
What grade do you need to attain in stats to not upset your future plans, What is your plan?
